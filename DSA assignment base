## Assignment Overview

The following problems were explored in this assignment:

1. **Ternary and Interpolation Searching Algorithms**  
   Research and explanation of how these algorithms work, including time complexities and real-world usage.

2. **Algorithm to Find the Smallest Number in a List/Array**  
   A simple algorithm that iterates through a list to identify the minimum value.

3. **Algorithm to Find the Second or Third Largest Element**  
   Efficient methods to determine the 2nd or 3rd largest values in an array without full sorting.

4. **Iterative vs Recursive Approaches**  
   Explanation of both approaches with examples and a comparison of when to use which.

5. **Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive Implementations)**  
   Coded implementations of binary search using both iterative and recursive methods, along with performance comparison.
